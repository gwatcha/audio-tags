# Audio Classification With Tags/Qualifiers:

This is a try at a tag/qualifier based classification system for audio. I use it
to organize my field recordings with help from an app called 'tagspaces'. Later
on, I can find recordings that match (or don't match) some set of
characteristics. As an example, I could get all my recordings that have
'envelopes with sharp attack, steady texture, a single sound source, and made
with solid objects' .

## Tags

Note that tags indicate the presence of some trait *at some* point or region in a
recording, since recordings may be pretty long and varied with content.

I list them in the form of:

> TAG GROUP :tag1:tag2
> 
> -   tag1
>     tag1 explanation
> 
> &#x2026;

My main source was this [handbook](https://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio-webdav/handbook/index.html).

### PARALLELISM     :singular:compound:parallel:

Amount of [sound objects](https://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio-webdav/handbook/Sound_Object.html) that occur at once.

-   singular
    one sound object.
    may also include quasi singular sounds like traffic at a distance.
    e.g. guitar string pluck
-   compound
    multiple distinct sound objects occuring to form an emergent sound object
    e.g. many pebbles hitting plastic, washing machine
-   parallel
    multiple non-emergent objects or compound objects co-occuring (cafeteria, sidewalk ambience)


<a id="org1556975"></a>

### ENVELOPE     :stationary:impulse:pulse:flux:

See [envelope](https://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio-webdav/handbook/Envelope.html)
The pattern in the overall intensity of the sound object.
E.g pebbles shuffling in hand [compound impulse]

-   stationary
    intensity is consistent, see [stationary](https://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio-webdav/handbook/Stationary_Sound.html)
-   impulse
    sharp attack. see [impulse](https://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio-webdav/handbook/Impact_Sound.html)
-   pulse
    a short envelope, without high attack
-   flux
    gradual change in intensity, growth or decay 
    e.g waves


<a id="org105a9cc"></a>

### SPECTRUM     :broad:tonal:shifting:

-   broad
    imperceptible dominant pitch
    e.g. gong, noise
    (adapted from Schaeffer's 'complex mass' qualifier)
-   tonal
    perceptible dominant pitch
    e.g. guitar string
-   moving
    is the dominant band or pitch moving?
    e.g. siren
    (adapted from Schaeffer's 'varied mass' qualifier)


<a id="org0eb57e1"></a>

### INTERNAL DYNAMICS     :granular:transients:

The pattern in the intensity of the sustained part of a sound. See [internal dynamics](https://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio-webdav/handbook/Internal_Dynamics.html)

-   granular
    The sustained sound is made of [grains](https://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio-webdav/handbook/Grain.html)
    e.g. a guiro
-   transients 
    The sustained sound has [transients](https://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio-webdav/handbook/Transient.html) - sudden and brief fluctuation in
    a sound. 
    e.g. a record player that crackles


<a id="org16e97a8"></a>

### TEXTURE     :morphing:steady:spacious:rub:vocal:scrape:diffuse:pure:buzz:fizz:hiss:harsh:warm:

The qualitative feel of the sustained part of the sound


<a id="org55d39eb"></a>

### OBJECT VARIANCE     :chaotic:varied:nuanced:

Describes the variance of the qualities of [sound object's](https://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio-webdav/handbook/Sound_Object.html) across time. 

-   chaotic
    e.g. IKEA food section, busy market square,
-   varied
    new sound objects succeed old ones with noticeably different qualities, but
    there is still structure
    e.g. voices on sidewalk of busy street, bird calls
-   nuanced
    subtle, or no variation in qualities of successive sound objects
    e.g. hitting a dog bowl different ways, different bird calls


<a id="org20cd87f"></a>

### ELEMENT     :fire:earth:air:water:

Elements involved in the production of the sound. This category helps me the most!
Elements combine in an intuitive way. For example:

electric saw cutting[fire earth]
rain drops on leaves[water earth]
water boiling[fire water]
gust through the trees[air earth]

-   fire
    A non-kinetic process, like a chemical reaction, or electricity 
    e.g. broken light, radio static
-   earth
    Solids.
    e.g. exciting an object with another one, rustling leaves, plucking a string
-   air
    Gas.
    e.g. wind, horns, whistles
-   water
    Liquid.
    e.g. water stream

## Examples

-   cafeteria ambience[parallel stationary air earth chaotic]
-   birds in forest[compound pulse tonal vocal varied]
-   dog bark[singular pulse broad vocal]
-   xylophone mallet hit[singular impulse flux tonal steady pure earth]
-   radio static voices[compound stationary pulse broad tonal transients vocal hiss morphing chaotic fire]
-   blown bottle top[compound stationary tonal hiss steady air earth]
