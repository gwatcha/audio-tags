# Audio Classification With Tags/Qualifiers:

This is a try at a tag/qualifier based classification system for audio. I use it
to organize my field recordings with help from an app called 'tagspaces'. Later
on, I can find recordings that match (or don't match) some set of
characteristics. As an example, I could get all my recordings that have
'envelopes with sharp attack, steady texture, a single sound source, and made
with solid objects' .

## Definitions

'[sound object](https://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio-webdav/handbook/Sound_Object.html)' : the smallest self-contained element of a [soundscape](https://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio-webdav/handbook/Soundscape.html). In my model, sound objects live as long
as their [envelope](https://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio-webdav/handbook/Envelope.html) lives.

## Tag/Qualifier Groups

Note that tags indicate the presence of some trait *at some* point or region in a
recording, since recordings may be pretty long and varied with content.


<a id="org397ce2c"></a>

### PARALLELISM     :singular:compound:parallel:

Amount of [sound objects](https://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio-webdav/handbook/Sound_Object.html) that occur at once.

1.  singular

    one sound object.
    may also include quasi singular sounds like traffic at a distance.
    e.g. guitar string pluck

2.  compound

    multiple distinct sound objects occuring to form an emergent sound object
    e.g. many pebbles hitting plastic, washing machine

3.  parallel

    multiple non-emergent objects or compound objects co-occuring (cafeteria, sidewalk ambience)


<a id="org2669e63"></a>

### ENVELOPE     :stationary:impulse:pulse:flux:

See [envelope](https://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio-webdav/handbook/envelope.html).
The pattern in the overall intensity of the sound object.
E.g pebbles shuffling in hand [compound impulse]

1.  stationary

    intensity is consistent, see [stationary](https://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio-webdav/handbook/Stationary_Sound.html)

2.  impulse

    sharp attack. see [impulse](https://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio-webdav/handbook/Impact_Sound.html)

3.  pulse

    a short envelope, without high attack

4.  flux

    gradual change in intensity, growth or decay 
    e.g waves


<a id="org6c4eba5"></a>

### SPECTRUM     :broad:tonal:shifting:

1.  broad

    imperceptible dominant pitch
    e.g. gong, noise
    (adapted from Schaeffer's 'complex mass' qualifier)

2.  tonal

    perceptible dominant pitch
    e.g. guitar string

3.  moving

    is the dominant band or pitch moving?
    e.g. siren
    (adapted from Schaeffer's 'varied mass' qualifier)


<a id="org59e6b3f"></a>

### TEXTURE

Tags related to texture. Texture characterizes the 'sustain' of a sound object.

1.  INTERNAL DYNAMICS     :granular:transients:

    The pattern in the intensity of the sustained part of a sound. See [internal dynamics](https://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio-webdav/handbook/Internal_Dynamics.html)
    
    1.  granular
    
        The sustained sound is made of [grains](https://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio-webdav/handbook/Grain.html)
        e.g. a guiro
    
    2.  transients
    
        The sustained sound has [transients](https://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio-webdav/handbook/Transient.html) - sudden and brief fluctuation in
        a sound. 
        e.g. a record player that crackles

2.  QUALITY     :spacious:rub:vocal:scrape:diffuse:pure:buzz:fizz:hiss:harsh:warm:

    The qualitative feel of the texture

3.  CHANGE     :morphing:steady:

    Textural qualities range / consistency of a sound object.


<a id="org6cf6a0f"></a>

### OBJECT VARIANCE     :chaotic:varied:nuanced:

Describes the variance of the qualities of [sound object's](https://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio-webdav/handbook/Sound_Object.html) across time. 

1.  chaotic

    e.g. IKEA food section, busy market square, 

2.  varied

    new sound objects succeed old ones with noticeably different qualities, but
    there is still structure
    e.g. voices on sidewalk of busy street, bird calls

3.  nuanced

    subtle, or no variation in qualities of successive sound objects
    e.g. hitting a dog bowl different ways, different bird calls


<a id="orge9f304f"></a>

### ELEMENT     :fire:earth:air:water:

Elements involved in the production of the sound. This category helps me the most!
Elements combine in an intuitive way. For example:

electric saw cutting[fire earth]
rain drops on leaves[water earth]
water boiling[fire water]
gust through the trees[air earth]

1.  fire

    A non-kinetic process, like a chemical reaction, or electricity 
    e.g. broken light, radio static

2.  earth

    Solids.
    e.g. exciting an object with another one, rustling leaves, plucking a string

3.  air

    Gas.
    e.g. wind, horns, whistles

4.  water

    Liquid.
    e.g. water stream


<a id="org796672e"></a>

## Examples

cafeteria ambience[parallel stationary air earth chaotic]
birds in forest[compound pulse tonal vocal varied]
dog bark[singular pulse broad vocal]
xylophone mallet hit[singular impulse flux tonal steady pure earth]
radio static voices[compound stationary pulse broad tonal transients vocal hiss morphing chaotic fire]
blown bottle top[compound stationary tonal hiss steady air earth]
