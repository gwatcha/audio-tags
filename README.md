# Audio Classification With Tags/Qualifiers:

This is a try at a tag/qualifier based classification system for audio. I use it
to organize my field recordings with help from an app called 'tagspaces'. Later
on, I can find recordings that match (or don't match) some set of
characteristics. As an example, I could get all my recordings that have
'envelopes with sharp attack, steady texture, a single sound source, and made
with solid objects' .

## Tag Groups

Note that the tags in the following tag groups indicate the presence of some trait *at some* point or region in a
recording; recordings may be pretty long and varied with content.


<a id="org451d6e9"></a>

### PARALLELISM

Amount of [sound objects](https://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio-webdav/handbook/Sound_Object.html) that occur at once.

-   singular  
    one sound object.
    may also include quasi singular sounds like traffic at a distance.
    e.g. guitar string pluck
-   compound  
    multiple distinct sound objects occuring to form an emergent sound object
    e.g. many pebbles hitting plastic, washing machine
-   parallel  
    multiple non-emergent objects or compound objects co-occuring (cafeteria, sidewalk ambience)


<a id="org67f779c"></a>

### ENVELOPE

See [envelope](https://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio-webdav/handbook/Envelope.html)
The pattern in the overall intensity of the sound object.
E.g pebbles shuffling in hand [compound impulse]

-   stationary  
    intensity is consistent, see [stationary](https://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio-webdav/handbook/Stationary_Sound.html)
-   impulse  
    sharp attack. see [impulse](https://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio-webdav/handbook/Impact_Sound.html)
-   pulse  
    a short envelope, without high attack
-   flux  
    gradual change in intensity, growth or decay 
    e.g waves


<a id="org75f5550"></a>

### SPECTRUM

-   broad  
    imperceptible dominant pitch
    e.g. gong, noise
    (adapted from Schaeffer's 'complex mass' qualifier)
-   tonal  
    perceptible dominant pitch
    e.g. guitar string
-   moving  
    is the dominant band or pitch moving?
    e.g. siren
    (adapted from Schaeffer's 'varied mass' qualifier)


<a id="orge2ab9bf"></a>

### INTERNAL DYNAMICS

The pattern in the intensity of the sustained part of a sound. See [internal dynamics](https://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio-webdav/handbook/Internal_Dynamics.html)

-   granular  
    The sustained sound is made of [grains](https://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio-webdav/handbook/Grain.html)
    e.g. a guiro
-   transients   
    The sustained sound has [transients](https://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio-webdav/handbook/Transient.html) - sudden and brief fluctuation in
    a sound. 
    e.g. a record player that crackles


<a id="orgd222a7e"></a>

### TEXTURE

The qualitative feel of the sustained part of the sound

-   morphing
-   steady
-   spacious
-   rub
-   vocal
-   scrape
-   diffuse
-   pure
-   buzz
-   fizz
-   hiss
-   harsh
-   warm


<a id="org4ed9b5f"></a>

### OBJECT VARIANCE

Describes the variance of the qualities of [sound object's](https://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio-webdav/handbook/Sound_Object.html) across time. 

-   chaotic  
    e.g. IKEA food section, busy market square,
-   varied  
    new sound objects succeed old ones with noticeably different qualities, but
    there is still structure
    e.g. voices on sidewalk of busy street, bird calls
-   nuanced  
    subtle, or no variation in qualities of successive sound objects
    e.g. hitting a dog bowl different ways, different bird calls


<a id="org16538a6"></a>

### ELEMENT

Elements involved in the production of the sound. This category helps me the most!
Elements combine in an intuitive way. For example:

electric saw cutting[fire earth]
rain drops on leaves[water earth]
water boiling[fire water]
gust through the trees[air earth]

-   fire  
    A non-kinetic process, like a chemical reaction, or electricity 
    e.g. broken light, radio static
-   earth  
    Solids.
    e.g. exciting an object with another one, rustling leaves, plucking a string
-   air  
    Gas.
    e.g. wind, horns, whistles
-   water  
    Liquid.
    e.g. water stream


<a id="orgd8af8ab"></a>

## Examples

-   cafeteria ambience[parallel stationary air earth chaotic]
-   birds in forest[compound pulse tonal vocal varied]
-   dog bark[singular pulse broad vocal]
-   xylophone mallet hit[singular impulse flux tonal steady pure earth]
-   radio static voices[compound stationary pulse broad tonal transients vocal hiss morphing chaotic fire]
-   blown bottle top[compound stationary tonal hiss steady air earth]
